# day_3

You are about to drive to your vacation destination.

You open Google Maps - it shows you that the estimated distance is A minutes at your normal pace.

You are in a hurry and do the following

->  At normal pace, in B minutes - you would have reached the rest point


->  You drive at 2Ã— the normal pace and reach the rest point in half the time.

->  After the rest point - you drive at your normal pace again

What is your total travel time?

# Input format
->  The first line contains two space separated integers A, B - as per the problem statement.

# Output format
->  Print in a single line - your total travel time.

# Constraints
->  1 <= A,B <= 1000

->  B is an even Intger.

# CODE

    import java.util.*;

    public class problem2 {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

        int A,B;
        A=sc.nextInt();  // taking A as normal time to reach a destination 
        B=sc.nextInt();  // taking B as you would have reached the rest point

        int z=(B/2);    // as we are travelling in 2X speed to rest point
        System.out.println(A-z); // print the  total travel time.
      }
    }

# Output
A=1000
B=220

output= 890
